# Tasky

Android app prototype made with react native and mongodb. The code is very bad because it was made in a very short time for a typical Innovation course that asks for a working app as final project.

## How to run

```bash
    # clone repo
    cd tasky-app-react-native
    node scripts/set-environment.js development
    npm start
    # open another terminal inside the project
    react-native run-android
```
